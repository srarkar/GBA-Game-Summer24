Welcome to a classic snake game -- with a twist! Press START to play.
Our snake needs help grabbing some apples (with randomly generated locations!).
However, make sure to avoid the WALLS and sneaky POISON IVY!
This snake is always on the move -- you just need to direct his movement with arrow keys.
Press SELECT at any point in the program to return to the START screen.
There are TWO ways to win this game: collect all the apples, or survive until the timer runs out!
You only LOSE if you hit a wall or ivy -- good luck!
